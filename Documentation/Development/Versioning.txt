# Many ways to determine the Tcl version, not all equal:

package provide Tcl
info tclversion
info patchlevel
return $tcl_version
return $tcl_patchLevel

# You can reliably compare version numbers as well, like so:
package vcompare [package provide Tcl] 8.5 ;# essentially signum(B-A)

set required_tcl_patchlevel 8.5
if {[package vcompare [package provide Tcl] $required_tcl_patchlevel] < 0} {
	puts stderr "Tcl version [package provide Tcl] inadequate; need at least $required_tcl_patchlevel"
	exit
}


if {[package vcompare [package require Expect] 5.44] < 0} {puts fail}

# Of course, loading a package will report the version number, and if you require a specific minimum version, you can specify that as an argument to [package require].

% package require Expect 5.45
version conflict for package "Expect": have 5.44.1.14, need 5.45



# The "Tcl" package is special though because it's never loaded explicitly.

# Also, STUBS...?
