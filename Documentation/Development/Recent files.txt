-- Most recent files

-- First, need to find the most recent load timestamp for each file, then order by date and limit to top (say) 10:

select Filename, max(Date_Performed) as Timestamp from File_Log
where Operation = 'LOAD'
group by Filename
order by Timestamp
limit 10;

-- TODO: include the entire PK in the grouping, or restrict to files on the current machine.

-- Hm, I should really normalise all the filenames as they're going in...could end up with lots of ".git/COMMIT_EDITING" entries that are really different files.
