On Marvin, I could use Tk's [send] command with abandon.  But trying Piaf on Zaphod, I get:
"X server insecure (must use xauth-style authorization); command ignored"

This has more info:

Ah, Tk doesn't like ANY kind of authentication enabled through xhost.
To disable:

#!/bin/sh
for host in `xhost | sed 1d` ; do
  echo removing $host from access control list
  xhost -$host
done
echo removing general access from access control list
xhost -
