TODO:

 - Investigate generating a new virtual event when a change of the insert mark is detected (to avoid having a whole bunch of [after]s watching things)
 - Have paste replace current selection
 - Have closing the window cause the graceful [quit] routine to be run
 - Detect unsaved changes on [close_file]
 - Fix erratically funky Frink results
 - Have stop_frinkserver run it the background somehow (currently it hangs the GUI)
 - Status display of frinkserver status?  At least "starting"/"shutting down"
 - support "Esc" for dismissing the Find panel
 - A prompt panel, in the event of unsaved changes when quitting
 - get list of recent files (and show in menu/sidebar)
 - Project menu and functionality
 - Redo top-level geometry as grid (for easier hide/show of components)
 - Navigate/Navigation/Move menu
 - Horizontal scrolling (with scrollbar only when needed?)
 - Set more appropriate (smaller) width and height of text widget (and also set initial geometry for non-tiling window systems)
 - jump to insert point when inserting via commands
 - Display lines loaded in statusbar
        maybe not necessary, as we now have a live char/word/line counter display
 - highlight current line
 - load/save filters for converting line endings and character encodings
 - Separate character, word and line count statusbar items
 - Make char/word/line count computation happen truly in the background.
 - Transformation: "strip blank lines"
 - Transformation: "remove duplicate characters/lines"
 - Maybe have text transformations apply to the entire editor buffer if there is no selection active.
 - Have text transformations apply correctly when there are multiple selection ranges.
 - Have install script accept a destination argument (and patch Piaf's script path accordingly?!)
 - Have the file log normalise filenames for full path
 - file log (database) browser
 - Record full hostname + domain name in file log
 - Create appropriate database indexes
 - Handle multiple files?!?!
 - About, Help menus
 - Various menu items for commands
 - Generic error dialog/panel?
 - Lexical colouring/highlighting for various languages
 - Language-specific Insert submenu(s)?
	including a language-sensitive "strip comment lines" transformation
 - Folding?
