TODO:

 - Toggleable line up/down movement behaviour; see http://wiki.tcl.tk/3082
 - Enter/Return to save by default in "unsaved" panel (focus?)
 - Add alert label to "unsaved" panel?
 - Strip code prior to sending to Frink.  And only send it one line!
 - Fix erratically funky Frink results
 - Have stop_frinkserver run in the background somehow (currently it hangs the GUI)
 - Status display of frinkserver status?  At least "starting"/"shutting down"
 - Fix "X server insecure (must use xauth-style authorization); command ignored"
 - Have find panel use grid!  Also, find out why it currently makes the X server go crazy busy!
 - support "Esc" for dismissing the Find panel
 - get list of recent files (and show in menu/sidebar)
 - Detect Linux distro and install dependencies (if necessary? - detecting what's iinstalled might be harder than just installing needlessly)
 - Project menu and functionality
 - Redo top-level geometry as grid (for easier hide/show of components)
 - Navigate/Navigation/Move menu
 - Horizontal scrolling (with scrollbar only when needed?)
 - Set more appropriate (smaller) width and height of text widget (and also set initial geometry for non-tiling window systems)
 - jump to insert point when inserting via commands
 - Display lines loaded in statusbar
        maybe not necessary, as we now have a live char/word/line counter display
 - highlight current line
 - load/save filters for converting line endings and character encodings
 - Separate character, word and line count statusbar items
 - Make char/word/line count computation happen truly in the background.
 - Command: "Select None" (cf. "Select All")
 - Transformation: "strip blank lines" (those that consist solely of whitespace, or those matching "\n" only?)
 - Transformation: "remove duplicate characters/lines"
 - Maybe have text transformations apply to the entire editor buffer if there is no selection active.
 - Have text transformations apply correctly when there are multiple selection ranges.
 - Have install script accept a destination argument (and patch Piaf's script path accordingly?!)
 - Have the file log normalise filenames for full path
 - Make the database optional, in case of no sqlite3 Tcl library
 - file log (database) browser
 - Record full hostname + domain name in file log
 - Create appropriate database indexes
 - Handle multiple files?!?!
 - About, Help menus
 - Various menu items for commands
 - Generic error dialog/panel?
 - Lexical colouring/highlighting for various languages
 - Language-specific Insert submenu(s)?
	including a language-sensitive "strip comment lines" transformation
 - Folding?



DONE:

 - Added modification event generation to "load" proc.
 - More generous line spacing
 - Pop-up panel when unsaved changes exist.
 - Use highlighting to show the extent of the file (visible end of file).
 - Fix bug in selection line counting which causes " characters to be treated as linebreaks.
 - Frink integration in Reference menu?   Spawn an ongoing background server-type process with Expect?
 - Find/Search dialog/toolbar/popup thingy
 - Tooltips, e.g. full path for brief filename in statusbar
 - Updating of line/column numbers in statusbar
 - Factored out colour and font settings
 - Window title now shows filename
 - Set "insert" mark to 0.0 on startup/file load
 - Fixed browser variable references
 - "Sort lines" transformation and menu
 - Added separate settings file
 - Reference menu, with Wikipedia, Google, etc. searches
 - Set focus to text widget on startup
 - Menu item for New
 - Handle file load/save dialogs returning no filename/empty string
 - Handle nonexistent file passed on command line
 - Don't CWD, just prepend the installation binary path
 - Basic command-line argument handling
 - Change directory at startup so support scripts can be sourced
 - Fixed path errors in install script
 - Added file slurp proc (I'd previously relied on the one in my ~/.tclshrc!)
 - Implemented commands, menus and bindings for basic file operations
 - Split out statusbar functions into new file
 - Added filename to statusbar
 - Added operation status to statusbar
 - Basic command-line argument handling
 - Made SQL DDL script at least syntactically valid
 - Added beginnings of an install script
 - Rearranged main menu order slightly
