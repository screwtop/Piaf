# Spelling with aspell (using a pipe)

#[ ] Introduce a "get_line <LINE_NUMBER>" command, because aspell works by lines, and because we should be using "after idle" and piece-wise transmission of the text to the external program for retaining GUI responsiveness.

#	Oh, already has. :)

#Now start and interact with aspell.  Probably makes sense for each Piaf instance to have its own aspell instance (sharing them is probably not scalable, and each probably needs its own language settings anyway).  I'd normally use Expect for stuff like this...but will bgexec work?

# Strangely, in the testing tclsh, alernate lines from stdin are sent to aspell instead of Tcl.  Weird.

	# Where should "after idle" go here?  Around the lot? OR just the output?  Would need to use ::line instead if so..or construct the "after" body literally using [list]?
	# In order to highlight misspelled words, this proc needs to know what line number was being checked.  However, aspell only deals with one line at a time, and reports only the character indexes for the current line.  Because the procesing of results from aspell is asynchronous, we have no way of passing the line number to this proc.  So, we probably have to send a line to aspell and deal with the results before sending another line, so that this proc can read the current line number variable itself.
	# It will probably also be necessary to inject a phony misspelled word at the end of each line so that we can detect that there are no more misspellings for the current line and can continue with the next.  Something like " PIAF_ASPELL_EOL".

check_spelling

#every 1000 check_spelling
# Or just have check_spelling run itself again after idle/delay.  More flexible to be able to call check_spelling on demand, though.  Also to be able to turn off periodic spellchecking.
# Regarding shifting line numbers: at least the text widget will bump existing tags with lines anyway.  Expect some glitches though.  As race conditions go, some shimmering of text highlighting isn't too bad.
