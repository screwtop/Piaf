While the new Flex-based lexical scanner was running, unsaved dialog popped up, chose discard, and then the unsaved panel didn't quite disappear, followed by this:

<<
process_scanner_results: OK to close channel.
process_scanner_results: unknown condition; will try to continue...
process_scanner_results: OK to close channel.
User chose: discard
TkBTreeLinesTo couldn't find line



rlwrap: warning: tclsh8.5 killed by SIGABRT (core dumped).
rlwrap has not crashed, but for transparency,
it will now kill itself with the same signal

Aborted (core dumped)
