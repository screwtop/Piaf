This is Piaf, a simple text editor written in Tcl/Tk with SQLite.

Basically I wanted a simple, flexible text editor that worked the way I wanted it to.  It doesn't have to be all-singing, all-dancing, seamlessly integrated into every different platform, or endlessly customisable.  Just lightweight, unobtrusive, safe, and capable.

To install, run "install", e.g.

sh install
