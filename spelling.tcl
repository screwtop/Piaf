# For proper asynchronous spellchecking, I think we need to make a copy of the entire text in a variable first (for atomicity):

	# TODO: apply those removals line by line, as the spellcheck proceeds.
	# Indeed, it would be sensible to limit the spellchecking to the current line, once the main document has been checked once through (in the background).

	# Split into words:
	foreach index [regexp -all -indices -inline "\[A-Za-z\]+" $text] {

		set end [lindex $index 1]
